\section{Tests}

\subsection{Equality of final states or configurations}

Final state of reachable memory and global variables yielded by the Isabelle interpreter is the same as the one yielded by the generated, compiled and run C program.

\subsection{Generation of Tests}

\subsubsection{Integer Values}
\subsubsection{Pointers}

\subsection{Generation of code with tests}
using the test harness and the C macros.
The semantics stays the same during the translation process.
What properties are covered by this test suite?

\section{Example programs}
