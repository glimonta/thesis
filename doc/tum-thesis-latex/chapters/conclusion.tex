\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{chapter:conclusion}

Future work includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Parsing C tests from the gcc torture test suite and translating to our semantics in order to generate and test C code from them.
\item Formalize proof rules for the language, separation logic for pointers
\item Link the language with the Isabelle Refinement Framework so programs from the Isabelle Refinement Framework can be refined to programs in this language.
\item Expand the set of expressions and instruccions, doesn't add computational power to the language but adds comfort for the programmer.
\item Add a type system.
\end{itemize}
