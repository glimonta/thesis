\section{CompCert Project}

\subsection{Program Logics Andrew W. Appel}

Relevant to this part is the Program Logics for Certified Compilers book from Andrew W. Appel.
This project uses the same memory model used in this work and that's why it's relevant.

\section{C formalized in HOL, Michael Norrish}

Norrish has a formalized C semantics in HOL, our semantics is also formalized in HOL.

\section{Different approach (From C code to semantics)}

Mildly interesting, the AutoCorres project parses C code and abstracts it as many other VCGs out there.
We are \textbf{generating} C code, this is the opposite direction.
